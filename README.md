## Introduction

### What is a Vulnerability?
- A vulnerability is a hole or a weakness in the application, which can be a design flaw or an implementation bug, that allows an attacker to cause harm to the stakeholders of an application. 
> Stakeholders include the application owner, application users, and other entities that rely on the application.

### Examples of Vulnerabilities

### List of Vulnerabilities

##### Allowing Domains or Accounts to Expire

##### Buffer Overflow
- Buffer overflow occurs when an attempt is made to store data that is too big for the memory space allocated. Attackers can use this software coding mistake, where the storage capacity of a program is overwritten, to take control of or to access your system. This vulnerability tends to be more common in software written in C and C++. Many programming languages have automatic protection against buffer overflow attacks.
