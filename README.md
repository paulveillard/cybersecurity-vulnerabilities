## Introduction

### What is a Vulnerability?
- A vulnerability is a hole or a weakness in the application, which can be a design flaw or an implementation bug, that allows an attacker to cause harm to the stakeholders of an application. 
> Stakeholders include the application owner, application users, and other entities that rely on the application.

### Examples of Vulnerabilities

- Lack of input validation on user input
- Lack of sufficient logging mechanism
- Fail-open error handling
- Not closing the database connection properly

### List of Vulnerabilities

##### Allowing Domains or Accounts to Expire

##### Buffer Overflow
- Buffer overflow occurs when an attempt is made to store data that is too big for the memory space allocated. Attackers can use this software coding mistake, where the storage capacity of a program is overwritten, to take control of or to access your system. This vulnerability tends to be more common in software written in C and C++. Many programming languages have automatic protection against buffer overflow attacks.

### How to Identify Software Vulnerabilities
The common methods of identifying vulnerabilities in a software project are:

- Source Code Scanning using automated tools that run against a source code repository or module, finding string patterns deemed to potentially cause security vulnerabilities.
 - Automated Penetration Testing (black/grey box) through penetrating testing tools automatic scans, where the tool is installed on the network with the web site being tested, and runs a set of pre-defined tests against the web site URLs.
- Manual Penetration Testing, again using tools, but with the expertise of a penetration tester performing more complicated tests.
- Secure Code Review with a security subject matter expert.

### How to Prevent Software Vulnerabilities
> These are some common ways to prevent software vulnerabiltiies (not a mitigation guideline)

#### 1. Test Your Software
Itâ€™s a good practice to test your software often as this will help you find and get rid of vulnerabilities quickly. You can test your software using code analysis tools, white box testing, black box testing, and other techniques.

#### 2. Update the Software Regularly
It is important to regularly update software as outdated software is prone to vulnerabilities. By making sure your software uses up to date components and dependencies, you can prevent security issues and software vulnerabilities.

#### 3. Set Up Software Design Requirements
Define a set of principles that need to be followed while developing each software release. These principles will show the developers how to write, inspect, and demonstrate their code to ensure security best practices are followed. Following the latest information from organizations such as CWE, OWASP, and CERT will also help you detect and prevent vulnerabilities.

#### 4. Use a Code Signing Certificate
Digitally signing your code using a code signing certificate will make your code tamper-proof, making it impossible for third parties to tamper with your code. A code signing certificate will make sure your files remain secure and it will also prevent hackers from adding security vulnerabilities to your code.
